# Site Cloning

If the site in the app is blocked for your region, you can make a clone of that by using the info of a site that is working for you. The site has to be the mirror of the site that is already in the app. You can't clone a site of different structure.

## Process

[!badge variant="light" text="Step 1"] A name (completely arbitrary, this is what will be displayed in the app)

[!badge variant="light" text="Step 2"] The clone site URL with `https://` at the front

[!badge variant="light" text="Step 3"] A two letter [language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (this will dictate how the site is displayed and sorted within the app, just enter en if you are unsure)
